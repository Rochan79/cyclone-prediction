# cyclone-prediction
Recently, Orissa was hit by cyclone Fani and caused a lot of destruction. I believe machine learning could help in prediction beforehand so that it could help minimize the losses. I initially plan to collect all kinds of resources, I'll put a description of those in the readme as I add them.  Any contributions are welcome, this is a humanitarian repository
